Description:
This game is a two player turn-based game which is played in a 5 x 8 sized board. The goal of the
game is to get to the opposite side of the board. To achieve this one must select where he/she
wants to step and must guess where would his/her opponent step. If one of the player's guess is
right, his/her opponent must stay in its place. If both players' guess was right, noone steps.
Both player can stay on the same tile on the same time. If the players reach the opposite side,
it's draw.
